# Pi-Temperature

**Pi-Temperature** is a project designed to monitor and display the temperature of a Raspberry Pi. This project retrieves the CPU temperature data from the Raspberry Pi and provides it in a readable format. It's useful for monitoring the health of your device, especially when it's running CPU-intensive tasks or in environments where overheating might be a concern.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously reads the current CPU temperature of the Raspberry Pi.
- **Lightweight**: The script is designed to use minimal resources, making it perfect for running on resource-limited devices like the Raspberry Pi.
- **Customizable**: You can adjust the frequency of the temperature checks to suit your needs.
- **Simple and Clean Output**: Displays the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit with a clean output in the terminal.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, you need to ensure the following:

- Raspberry Pi with a running Linux-based OS (Raspbian or any other Linux distro).
- Python 3 installed on the system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jeridizel/Pi-Temperature.git
